Hoặc doanh nghiệp có thể chủ động tạo ra một sự pha trộn có chọn lọc giữa các hệ thống và quy trình để theo đuổi mục tiêu chính – đó là bán sản phẩm hoặc dịch vụ của riêng họ.\n\nCác dự án khởi nghiệp thành công sẽ không ngay lập tức tung ý tưởng đầu tiên ra thị trường. Thay vào đó, sản phẩm / dịch vụ của họ thường phải trải qua nhiều lần thử nghiệm và sửa đổi để đưa ra bản hoàn thiện cuối cùng.\n\nTương tự như vậy, các doanh nghiệp sẽ bớt rủi ro và bền vững hơn nếu họ cân nhắc một vài mô hình kinh doanh trước khi quyết định sử dụng một mô hình cụ thể."

Phân khúc khách hàng là một phần thiết yếu trong mô hình kinh doanh của tổ chức. Nó cũng là kênh tham chiếu đảm bảo các tính năng của sản phẩm phù hợp với đặc điểm và nhu cầu của phân khúc.\n\nĐể chia phân khúc khách hàng hiệu quả, đầu tiên bạn phải hiểu biết về khách hàng thông qua nhu cầu hiện tại và tương lai của họ. Sau đó, bạn cần liệt kê và sắp xếp khách hàng theo thứ tự ưu tiên, bao gồm danh sách các khách hàng tiềm năng trong tương lai. Cuối cùng là đánh giá kỹ lưỡng khách hàng bằng cách tìm hiểu điểm mạnh và điểm yếu của họ, đồng thời khám phá các tệp khách hàng khác có thể mang lại nhiều lợi ích nếu công ty tập trung và họ.\n\nCác phương pháp phân khúc khách hàng bao gồm:\n\nThị trường đại chúng (Mass Market): Với phân khúc này, doanh nghiệp có một lượng khách hàng tiềm năng lớn vì họ cảm thấy sản phẩm có thể giải quyết nhu cầu chung của dân số. Ví dụ điển hình là bột giặt.\nThị trường ngách (Niche Market): Phân khúc khách hàng này dựa trên những nhu cầu cụ thể và độc đáo của khách hàng. Ví dụ, tập đoàn Louis Vuitton đã tập trung vào sản xuất các sản phẩm thời trang đắt giá để cung cấp cho tầng lớp khách hàng thượng lưu trên thế giới.\nThị trường phân đoạn (Segmented): Các doanh nghiệp sử dụng cách tiếp cận này sẽ tiếp tục phân khúc khách hàng trong tập phân khúc chính nhờ dựa trên sự khác biệt nhỏ về nhân khẩu học và nhu cầu của khách hàng.\nThị trường đa dạng (Diversify): Một công ty với cách phân khúc này sẽ liên tục thay đổi sản phẩm / dịch vụ linh hoạt để phù hợp với nhu cầu của các phân khúc khách hàng có các đặc điểm và nhu cầu không giống nhau.\nThị trường đa chiều (Multi-sided Platform/Market): Nó phục vụ các khách hàng có các mối quan hệ với nhau. Thị trường đa chiều giống như cách trang blog cần thu hút các nhà quảng cáo để giúp họ tạo ra dòng tiền, bửi vậy nên cần một lượng lớn blogger hoạt động. Do vậy, mô hình kinh doanh thành công của các trang blog đòi hỏi hệ thống kéo với cả hai phân khúc này."

Các doanh nghiệp có thể tập trung giảm chi phí qua việc giảm vốn đầu tư vào kinh doanh hoặc tập trung vào giá trị sản phẩm (chẳng hạn như tập trung tối đa giá trị cho khách hàng).\n\nDưới đây là một số đặc điểm chung của cơ cấu chi phí:\n\nChi phí cố định (Fixed Costs): chi phí không đổi trong một khoảng thời gian.\nChi phí biến động (Variable Costs): giống như tên gọi, chi phí này thay đổi tuỳ theo phương sai trong sản xuất.\nTính kinh tế theo quy mô (Economies of Scale): chi phí giảm khi quy mô sản xuất tăng lên.\nTính kinh tế theo phạm vi (Economies of Scope): chi phí giảm bằng cách đầu tư vào những hoạt động liên quan đến sản phẩm chính.\nDĩ nhiên, bước đầu tiên bạn cần làm là xác định tất cả các chi phí liên quan đến doanh nghiệp. Hiểu biết thực tế về các chi phí là một trong những yếu tố quan trọng của một mô hình kinh doanh tốt.\n\nSau bước xác định, việc liệt kê tất cả các chi phí trong mô hình kinh doanh Canvas rất cần thiết để bạn có thể nhìn chúng dưới góc độ trực quan và lên kế hoạch cho từng loại. Bạn có thể cắt giảm một số chi phí qua các biện pháp đo lường nhất định. Đồng thời, bạn sẽ phải tăng một số chi phí nếu bạn quyết định đầu tư vào khoản mục cụ thể có thể gia tăng lợi nhuận trong tương lai."
