The designed objects around you subtly influence your thoughts about governments and policy.

Propaganda is the spread of ideas to influence public opinion. It's often to support a specific political group or cause. So how is propaganda different from regular marketing or advertising? Well, they use the same techniques, but basically, advertising is meant to influence what you buy; propaganda is meant to influence what you think.",

That's not just for artistic flair; it's a strategic choice. Scribes developed intricate writing styles because they were difficult to imitate so that other people couldn't copy the king's commands.

Even today, almost all banknotes are ornately decorated and feature prominent leaders. The reasons mirror those of ancient scribes with their complex handwriting: to show authority and to prevent counterfeiting. These symbols carry incredible weight.

Each one of these blades only costs about 10 cents each. But actually, if you click the link in the description below, you can get your first 100 blades for free, which is going to last you at least a few years.

First was efficiency in mass production. Here are two Ford Model Ts. These might look really similar, but this 1909 Model T would take 12 hours to manufacture. By 1914, they were making one car every 93 minutes. It was less than half the price of the 1909 model, too.

Finally, you don't just anonymously submit your vote; you have to hand your color-coded voting choice to an election official. They'll know if you voted \"yes\" or \"no.\" Maybe you're not a fascist, but you think about the giant facade you just saw outside and say, \"You know what?

If you're not a designer or artist, it can be hard to discern fact from fiction, especially when it's intentionally hidden from us. In the end, the most powerful weapon against propaganda isn't more propaganda; it's in our curiosity to look beyond the facade. Thanks to all of my friends and patrons for helping me with this video.
