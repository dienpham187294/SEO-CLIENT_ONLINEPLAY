In the afternoon, I study at home and take a short walk outside. At night, I watch TV with my family and go to bed at 10:00 PM.\n\nSummer\nHello, I’m Emma. Summer is my favorite season. I wake up at 6:00 AM and go swimming in the morning. After that, I eat fruit and rest. In the afternoon, I read books or listen to music. The weather is very hot, so I drink cold juice. At night, I sleep with the fan on and dream about traveling to the beach.\n\nAutumn\nHi, I’m Emma. In autumn, I wake up at 7:00 AM. I eat breakfast and ride my bike to the park. The leaves are orange and yellow, and the weather is cool. I love walking and taking pictures of the trees. In the afternoon, I write in my journal and drink hot tea. I go to bed early because the days are shorter.\n\nWinter\nHello, I’m Emma. Winter is very cold, so I wake up at 8:00 AM. I drink hot chocolate to warm up. After breakfast, I sit by the fireplace and read books. In the afternoon, I wear warm clothes and go outside for a walk. At night, I enjoy dinner with my family and sleep under a thick blanket.",

I see a red dress and ask, “How much is this dress?” The shop assistant says, “It’s $30.” I try it on, and it fits perfectly. I ask, “Can I pay with my card?” The assistant says, “Yes, you can.” I pay for the dress and thank her.\n\nStory 2: The Shoe Shop\nHello, I’m Emma. I need new shoes for walking. At the shoe shop, I ask, “Do you have size 38?” The salesperson says, “Yes, we do. They are $50.” I try them on and ask, “Do you have these in black?” The salesperson finds black shoes for me. I like them, so I buy them with cash.\n\nStory 3: The Supermarket\nHi, I’m Emma. I go to the supermarket to buy some fruit. I ask the staff, “How much are the bananas?” She says, “They are $2 per kilo.” I say, “I’ll take 3 kilos, please.” At the checkout, I give cash and get my change. The bananas look fresh, and I am happy with my shopping.\n\nStory 4: The Electronics Store\nHello, I’m Emma. I need a new phone charger. At the electronics store, I ask, “How much is this charger?” The salesperson says, “It’s $20.” I ask, “Do you have a cheaper one?” He shows me another charger for $15. I decide to buy the cheaper one. I pay with my card and leave the store.",

Sometimes, I listen to music while I work in the garden. On weekends, I also enjoy baking cakes for my family.\n\nStory 2: Dad\nHello, I’m Emma’s dad. I like fishing in my free time. On Saturday mornings, I go to the river with my fishing gear. I enjoy the quiet and fresh air. Sometimes, I catch a big fish and bring it home for dinner. Fishing helps me relax after a busy week.\n\nStory 3: Brother\nHi, I’m Emma’s brother. I enjoy playing video games in my free time. I like racing games the most. I play with my friends online, and we have so much fun. When I am not gaming, I ride my bike around the park. Riding makes me feel free and happy.\n\nStory 4: Grandma\nHello, I’m Emma’s grandma. I love knitting in my free time. I make sweaters, scarves, and hats for my family. Knitting is relaxing and keeps me busy. Sometimes, I also enjoy reading books about history. In the evening, I watch TV shows with my grandchildren. They make me laugh.",

I ask a passerby, “Excuse me, how can I get to the Eiffel Tower?” He says, “Take the metro, line 6, and get off at Trocadéro station.” I thank him and follow the directions. The Eiffel Tower is amazing!\n\nStory 2: New York City\nHello, I’m Emma. In New York, I need to find Central Park. I ask a police officer, “Where is Central Park?” He says, “It’s straight ahead, about 10 minutes on foot.” I walk and see the park. It’s big and beautiful. I enjoy walking and taking pictures there.\n\nStory 3: Tokyo\nHi, I’m Emma. In Tokyo, I want to go to a sushi restaurant. I ask a shopkeeper, “How do I get to Sushi Street?” She says, “Go left, then right, and it’s near the train station.” I follow her directions and find the restaurant. The sushi is delicious!\n\nStory 4: Rome\nHello, I’m Emma. In Rome, I want to visit the Colosseum. I ask a man, “How can I get to the Colosseum?” He says, “Take bus number 75 and get off at the Colosseo stop.” I take the bus, and it’s easy to find.

I say to my friend, “It’s a perfect day for a picnic!” She replies, “Yes, let’s go to the park.” We bring food and enjoy the sunshine. I love sunny weather.\n\nStory 2: Rainy Day\nHello, I’m Emma. It’s raining today, so I take my umbrella. I say to my neighbor, “It’s a wet day!” He says, “Yes, it’s raining a lot this week.” I stay inside, drink tea, and read a book. Rainy days are quiet and relaxing for me.\n\nStory 3: Snowy Day\nHi, I’m Emma. Today, it’s snowing! The ground is white, and the air is very cold. I say to my brother, “Let’s build a snowman!” He says, “Great idea!” We play in the snow and take pictures. Snowy weather makes me happy, but I wear a warm coat.\n\nStory 4: Windy Day\nHello, I’m Emma. It’s very windy today. The trees are moving, and the air feels cool. I say to my mom, “It’s so windy outside!” She replies, “Be careful if you go out.” I wear my jacket and go for a short walk. Windy days are good for flying kites.",

I say, “I feel pain in my head, and it doesn’t go away.” The doctor asks, “Did you sleep well?” I say, “No, I didn’t.” He gives me medicine and says, “Rest and drink lots of water.”\n\nStory 2: Dad\nHello, I’m Emma’s dad. My back hurts after working in the garden. I visit the clinic and say, “My back hurts when I move.” The doctor says, “You should avoid heavy lifting and rest for a few days.” She gives me cream to help with the pain. I feel better soon.\n\nStory 3: Brother\nHi, I’m Emma’s brother. I have a fever, so my mom takes me to the doctor. I say, “I feel very hot and tired.” The doctor checks my temperature and says, “You have a fever. Drink lots of water and take this medicine.” After a few days, I feel healthy again.\n\nStory 4: Grandma\nHello, I’m Emma’s grandma. I feel dizzy and go to the hospital. I say, “I feel lightheaded when I stand up.” The doctor asks, “Are you eating well?” I say, “Not much.” He tells me to eat healthy food and drink juice. I follow his advice and feel stronger.",

At the station, I ask, “What time does the train to Paris leave?” The staff says, “It leaves at 9:30 AM.” I buy a ticket and wait on the platform. The train ride is fast and comfortable. I can’t wait to see the Eiffel Tower!\n\nStory 2: New York\nHello, I’m Emma. In New York, I take a taxi to visit Times Square. I ask the driver, “How long will it take to get there?” He says, “About 20 minutes.” The city is busy with traffic, but the lights and buildings are amazing. I enjoy the ride and take lots of pictures.\n\nStory 3: Tokyo\nHi, I’m Emma. In Tokyo, I take the subway to visit Shibuya Crossing. At the ticket machine, I ask a local, “Which line goes to Shibuya?” She says, “Take the green line.” I follow her advice and arrive in 15 minutes. The subway is clean and very fast.\n\nStory 4: Rome\nHello, I’m Emma. In Rome, I rent a bicycle to explore the city. I ask the shopkeeper, “How much is it to rent a bike for a day?” He says, “It’s $15.” I ride to the Colosseum and enjoy the view. Biking is a fun way to see the streets of Rome.",

In the morning, we open gifts together. I love spending time with my family during this special holiday. It is full of joy and love.\n\nStory 2: New Year’s Eve\nHello, I’m Emma. On New Year’s Eve, I celebrate with my friends. We watch fireworks at midnight. Before that, we have a party with snacks and music. Everyone says, “Happy New Year!” when the clock strikes 12. I make a wish and plan my goals for the new year.\n\nStory 3: Halloween\nHi, I’m Emma. Halloween is so much fun! I dress up as a witch and go to a party with my friends. We carve pumpkins and play games. Kids come to our door and say, “Trick or treat!” We give them candy. The costumes and decorations make Halloween exciting.\n\nStory 4: Birthday\nHello, I’m Emma. My birthday is in June. This year, my family throws me a small party at home. I blow out candles on a chocolate cake and make a wish. My friends give me gifts and sing “Happy Birthday.” We play games and take photos. It’s a wonderful day.",
